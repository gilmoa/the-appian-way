# Welcome to the Appian Way

## New and Shiny

After (several) years of neglect, I thought it was time I gave the site a thorough makeover. I've now ported all of the old content to a more modern (not to mention standards-compliant) CSS-based implementation, and I hope you'll all agree it looks a whole lot better.

The catalyst for this modernisation is, of course, **Caesar 4**. I had considerable technical difficulties with the shipping version of the game, but Patch 1.2 has got me up and running, and I'm really looking forward to playing it some more.

Along with the new look comes the prospect of new content, and a slightly new approach. Since I've haven't yet played the game particularly extensively, there are many aspects of the game I've not mastered, and my gameplay strategies are not yet mature enough for public consumption. Instead, I'm hoping to present a blow-by-blow account of my experiences with the game. Any strategies that arise out of those experiences will be added and revised as I go along. Hopefully, some people will find this interesting...
