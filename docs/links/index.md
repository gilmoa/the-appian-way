Whether you're searching for hints and tips you can't find here, fancy a chat with fellow Caesar addicts, or even want some competitive citybuilding action, there's something for you here.

- **Caesar4.Com**:
The official Caesar 4 site. Message board is a great place to pick up tips.
- **Tilted Mill Forums**:
Official forum run by the developers of Caesar IV. Hints, tips, and the occasional VIP visit abound...
- **Caesar 3 Heaven**:
The best, and still the most active, of all the C3 Message Boards. Strategy section has some useful articles, including walkthroughs.
- **Caesar 4 Heaven**:
Sister site to C3 Heaven, offering the same mix of informed discussion and excellent strategy.
- **CityBuildingContests.net**:
Looking for regular competitive action? I reckon you could do a lot worse than look here. Mind you, I am biased (I'm one of the co-founders!).
- **Which Way to Rome?**:
Probably the best strategy site going (after this one, of course!). Truckloads of game data, and excellent advice on how to use it effectively. Sadly no longer updated.
- **The Governor's Retreat**:
An impressive strategy compendium, with walkthroughs, housing blocks, military tips, and assorted bits and pieces. Run by Heavengames regular paultheo, it's well worth a visit.
- **Catilina's Caesar 3 Homepage**:
An invaluable resource for all you Macintosh governors out there - truckloads of Mac saved games from one of the top C3 players in the world!
- **Caesar Jan's Palace**:
Excellent hints, and useful downloads from another outstanding Macintosh governor!
