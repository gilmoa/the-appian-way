# Housing Data

On this page you will find a housing-related data. Specifically, you will find all the requirements for housing evolution, and all the characteristic properties of the various housing levels.

## Requirements

The following table summarises the requirements for housing to evolve to the various levels. Requirements are cumulative (you knew that!). All the data used can be found in the C3 Model Text file, and was originally presented in an amenable form on 'Which Way to Rome'.

[^1]: The values quoted are those required for evolution to this level. Desirability may subsequently fall a few points without devolution occuring.
[^2]: For an explanation of how Entertainment points are awarded, take a look at this page.
[^3]: Services listed are those other than Entertainment services.
[^4]: Clean Water is provided only by fountains (as if you didn't know...)
[^5]: Your patricians will have access to two types of wine in the following circumstances:
    - You are importing wine, and two different trade partners will sell it.
    - You are making wine from home-grown grapes, and importing it from one trade partner.
    - You are making wine from imported vines, and are also importing wine from one trade partner.

    It is important to note that you must continue to instruct your Trade Advisor to import wine, even when your wine warehouses are full. Further, in the second and third instances, you do not need to buy any wine. It is sufficient to instruct your Trade Advisor to import wine.
