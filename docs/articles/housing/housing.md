# Housing Blocks

## Introduction

A Housing Block is a template for building areas of housing. The positions of a large number of housing tiles, as well as service buildings, are predetermined. A player who uses Housing Blocks will build their housing in sections, rather than simply expanding existing areas of housing when the need arises. Housing Blocks designs can be as large or small as the designer chooses. The smaller the design, the more flexible it is. Housing Blocks tend to be used by intermediate/advanced players (and the occasional astute beginner), but that is not to say that all advanced players use them.

### Why use Housing Blocks?

There are several advantages to the use of Housing Blocks. I shall attempt to list them all. Some of these issues will be covered in greater detail elsewhere.

- **Worker Efficiency**:
Housing Blocks allow service buildings to cover a large number of houses reliably. The high house:service building ratio makes a large difference to citywide employment levels.

- **Housing Density**:
It is often (but not necessarily always) the case that housing blocks permit greater housing density. Thus, they are generally more space-efficient than a 'random' city

- **Housing Stability**:
Housing Blocks almost invariably produce stable housing. The importance of stability is discussed elsewhere.

- **Aesthetics**:
I would contend that Housing Blocks often look nice. Doubtless there are those who would disagree!

- **Walker Control**:
This a something of a pet topic of mine, so is discussed in more detail here.

The overwhelming take-home message is that Housing Blocks generally make for a much more efficient, stable, and generally easy-to-run city. In my opinion, anything that makes your life as a Governor easier is a good thing!

### OK - So what do they look like?

I have recently got into the habit of custom-designing Housing Blocks to suit the map I am playing. However, the majority of my designs fit into reasonably well-defined categories. The following are examples of Housing Blocks I have used that fit my general philosophy. I have also tried to explain why I like to use these kinds of blocks.

- Plebeian Housing
- Patrician Housing
- Gatehouseless Block

However, these may not be to your taste. Many people I know disagree with the use of Gatehouses in Housing Blocks. A couple of gatehouseless designs I have had success with have been included for comparison purposes. There are a number of alternatives available on other sites (see the Links section). Alternatively, should you wish to design a few of your own, I have compiled a little article on Block Design which you may find useful.

Finally, a few of my cities which illustrate these types of block in action are available for download from the Download section.

## Plebeian Housing

The following represent some plebeian hosuing designs I have had success with. Theseare not especially recent designs, and I hope to add more up-to-date designs soon, but for the time being these will serve to illustrate a number of points.

### Non-Desert Maps

The following design is suitable for use in in Central or Northern climates. It will not work in the desert due to the reduced range of fountains on Desert provinces. In Northern provinces, the prefecture is not required, and may be replaced with a statue, or anything else for that matter!
**INSERT MAP INSERT MAP INSERT MAP**

The Key points to note on this design are:

- **The use of a gatehouse**:
This confines all the random walkers to the inner ring road, while permitting destination walkers access to the rest of the city. (For more on walkers take a look here). Note also the use of an oracle to offset the negative desirability effect of the gatehouse.
- **The length of the inner ring**:
This is carefully controlled so that a random walker will always complete a full circuit on every patrol. This is achieved by having the loop less than twice the length of a random walker's standard patrol (about 30 tiles). When the random walker reaches the end of the patrol, they take the shortest route back to their building. In this design, the shortest route is round the rest of the loop!
- **The external feeder road**:
This road backs on to the outer houses, and may be used to provide labour access for industries, performer schools, granaries etc.
- **Fountain coverage**:
Although not the maximum possible, the central fountain services a very large number of housing tiles.
- **Target housing level**:
This block is designed to produce small insulae. However, with a few modifications, it is possible to produce stable large insulae, and probably even grand insulae.

### Desert Maps

And now for a desert-adapted version of the above...
**INSERT MAP INSERT MAP INSERT MAP**

This block is, in most respects, similar to its non-desert cousin. The major differences are:

- **Target housing level**:
This block is again designed for small insulae. However, this block is not stable beyond small insulae, due to desirability problems in the middle of that vast bank of housing.
- **The number of service buildings**:
This block contains several extra service buildings. These are not necessary for the evolution of the houses (one of each builing would suffice), but are there to bolster the city's overall culture rating. Note also the extra market, which is necessary to keep up with the demand from the extra tiles of housing.

## Palace Blocks

Palaces, and their lesser cousins, villas, are the upmost echelons of housing in C3. Their inhabitants, patricians, do not work. However, that is not to say that patricians are useless. They are useful for three reasons:

- **Money**:
The tax revenue generated by villas and palaces is enormous. This is partly because they have (in general) a larger population than plebeian houses but also because you collect more tax per capita from the patrician classes. Half a dozen luxury palaces will easily generate more tax income than you can spend. Also, since patricians don't work, you don't pay them any wages.
- **Prosperity Rating**:
As explained here, a few patrician houses will work wonders for your prosperity rating.
- **Unemployment**:
Obviously, since patricians do not work, having patricians reduces unemployment. This is extremely useful in cities with a high population target.

### It's not that hard, surely?

Building patrician housing is, in many ways, similar to building plebeian housing. However, palace building is the city-building process taken to ridiculous extremes. There are a number of issues which are particularly relevant to palace building:

- **Number of service buildings**:
Patrician housing requires access to most (if not all) of the services under the sun. To build luxury palaces you will need to provide every form of healthcare, entertainment, education and religious facilities. That is, quite simply, an awful lot of buildings. In order to fit them all in, an efficient layout is essential.
- **Food supply**:
Patricians require at least two (the more advanced levels require three) types of food. Supplying multiple food types is, quite simply, a headache. In the majority of provinces, this means using a less efficient food source (fruit/vegetable/meat farms rather than wheat). Furthermore, every market lady in the city will gravitate towards those extra food types unless you stop them.
- **Goods supply**:
Patrician housing requires access to all non-food goods (and a second type of wine if you want palaces). Again this can present logistical difficulties, especially when one or more raw materials need to be imported. Fortunately, non-food goods are consumed on a per house basis, so patrician housing uses comparatively small amounts of non-food goods. Supply of non-food goods may be accomplished by one of two methods: have small local industries producing finished goods near the palace block (1 workshop will provide enough for 20 palaces); centralised industries with 'getting' warehouses near the palace block.
- **Desirability**:
Palaces and villas need a lot of desirabilty. What this means is that your palace blocks will need to be decorated with large statues, oracles, triumphal arches an the like.

### So what's a good layout?

The layout I use most often was originally developed by Brugle, another regular at Caesar 3 Heaven. It looks a bit like this:
**INSERT MAP INSERT MAP INSERT MAP**

This is modified slightly from the original design, and will produce 6 rock-stable luxury palaces (assuming a supply of food and goods) in any climate. There are several noteworthy points:

- **Single ring design**:
A common motif in my housing blocks, this provides perfect coverage by random walkers. A single patrol will result in a complete circuit of the ring.
- **Fountain coverage**:
Only a few of the tiles from each palace have fountain coverage. When I build palaces I start them with a single 1x1 house in a sea of gardens, and let it expand when it needs to. This minimises the consumption of non-food goods, and also minimises the impact on unemployment when the block passes from grand insulae to small villa. An additional concern here is that you have to be careful to prevent the two adjacent palaces merging at an earlier stage of evolution.
- **Performer schools**:
This block requires an additional lion pit and chariot maker somewhere else in the city. I tend to put them in my second palace block.
- **Markets**:
The ratio one market : two palaces is worth remembering. It is an excellent rule of thumb.
- **Statues**:
That big row of statues is an ideal place to hide a nice triumphal arch....

### What if I need more palaces?

For the majority of career cities, six luxury palaces should be more than sufficient. However, you may encounter custom scenarios where more palaces are needed. If I decide I need more than six palaces, I tend to go the whole hog and build another six. Obviously I cannot use the same block (that would require another Hippodrome), so I tend to build my second block in a straight line, with the chariot maker at the far end. Something a bit like this:
**INSERT MAP INSERT MAP INSERT MAP**

Although marginally less space-efficient than my favourite block, the two do team together quite well. The big long line of statues down the side of this block can be used as part of the statue 'backbone' for my favourite block.

Although not a loop block, this housing block still retains a hefty degree of walker control. There is only one road through the block, so all the walkers have to use it. The destination walkers for the entertainment venues provide perfect coverage to all the houses.

## Gatehouseless Blocks

While I prefer the additional control given by blocks using gatehouses, I recognise that there are occasions when gatehouseless blocks are needed. The most obvious example is the earlier missions in the 'Peaceful' career path, where gatehouses are not available. Some players prefer not to use gatehouses outside their natural position in city defences, so I thought a couple of gatehouseless blocks would be a useful addition to the site.

### Non-Desert Maps

The following design is suitable for use in in Central or Northern climates. In Northern provinces, the prefecture is not required, and may be replaced with a clinic, generating an extra tile of housing.
**INSERT MAP INSERT MAP INSERT MAP**

After the single loop blocks (see here), this G-motif is the most common recurring theme in my city blocks. I use this type of block when gatehouses are not available. The key points are:

- **Prefecture and engineer placement**:
These buildings are deliberately placed at the end of the 'G', so that a full length patrol will pass every other building, giving protection from damage and fire.
- **Markets**:
I use rather more markets than I do normally in these gatehouseless blocks. I would normally serve a much larger block with 3 market, or a marginally smaller one with two markets.
- **Service Buildings**:
There are more service buildings than I would use to evolve a similar number of housing tiles in a loop block. This is partly to boost my Culture rating, and partly because the more unpredictable walker patterns mean that coverage is not quite as efficient in this block. The layout of the service buildings is not rigid. I have encountered problems with, for example, temple coverage, in some orientations of this block. However, there is nothing that a quick reshuffle of buildings cannot fix.
- **Target housing level**:
This block is tested at small insulae. However, with a few modifications (producing the desert version below) it is possible to get stable large insulae.

### Desert Maps

The dried-out version of the above...
**INSERT MAP INSERT MAP INSERT MAP**

In addition to the comments above, there are a few new points to be made here:

- **Fountain placement**:
Most of the large insulae obtain fountain coverage on only one or two of their tiles. In order to accommodate more people at a lower housing level, start with two additional fountains at the two corners (where the statues are), and then remove them once you have evolved your housing to large insulae.
- **Extra service buildings**:
The extra market is to reduce the strain on the existing markets. Remember that they have to get pottery, furniture and oil in addition to food. The extra library in the middle of the block is only there for a culture rating boost. It may be replaced by any other culture building, or an oracle if you encounter desirability problems (I didn't).
- **Target housing level**:
Tested at, and rock-stable at, large insulae. Much less efficient at any lower level.
