# Optimising Industry

The industries of C3 have been comparatively well-understood since the very early days, when trailblazers like Grumpus the Elder (whose site, 'Which Way to Rome', remains essential reading for the beginner) figured out all the production rates that form the core of this article. However, I do not feel it is sufficient to present this same data again, so I have included a few tips for optimising your industries.

## Production Rates

The annual production (in cartloads) for all the major industrial buildings is listed below. As you can see, there are some general rules that govern these production rates:

- Raw materials (except Marble) are produced at a rate of 9.6 cartloads per year.
- Finished goods (and Marble) are produced at a rate of 4.8 cartloads per year

| **Building**           | Annual Production (cartloads) |
| ---------------------- | :---------------------------: |
| **Clay Pit**           |              9.6              |
| **Timber Yard**        |              9.6              |
| **Olive Farm**         |              9.6              |
| **Vine Farm**          |              9.6              |
| **Iron Mine**          |              9.6              |
| **Marble Quarry**      |              4.8              |
| **Pottery Workshop**   |              4.8              |
| **Furniture Workshop** |              4.8              |
| **Oil Workshop**       |              4.8              |
| **Wine Workshop**      |              4.8              |
| **Weapons Workshop**   |              4.8              |

## Maximising Productivity

We can see that one raw material producer can provide for two workshops. However, the raw material producer has only one cartpusher, and if he fails to return from a delivery until after 100% production has been reached, then the raw material producer will stand idle, wasting valuable production time. As a consequence, in order to get the best out of a raw material producer, all the valid destinations for that raw material (usually the workshops) should be nearby (within 32 tiles). Similarly, warehouses accepting finished goods should be kept within a reasonable distance (64 tiles) of a workshop.

The simplest way to accomplish the above is to build centralised industries. Group together the raw material producers of one type in the same place, and put all the required workshops, and a warehouse accepting the finished product, close by. I tend to disconnect my industries from the rest of the city, but this is not strictly necessary. If I intend to distribute these goods to my populace, then I use 'getting' warehouses to move them around my city.

When exporting goods, it is always a good idea to meet your annual export quota. Assuming maximum productivity, the following are the minimum number of workshops needed to meet demand from a trade partner:

| Amount Purchased (cartloads/year) | Workshops Needed |
| :-------------------------------: | :--------------: |
|                15                 |        4         |
|                25                 |        6         |
|                40                 |        9         |

When establishing an Industry, it is a good idea to build more raw material producers than you immediately need. I typically start with one raw material producer and one workshop, then add another raw material producer, two further workshops, another raw material producer, and so on. This is to ensure a steady flow of raw materials to the new workshops, and thus have the workshops active as soon as possible. Once the industry is well established you can thin out the raw material producers (or add workshops) until the 2:1 ratio is established.

The final, rather obvious, tip is to always ensure you have enough workers for your industries, and that they have good labour access.
