# Designing a Challenge

I have been using the Caesar 3 map editor for quite some time, and have (as part of my work over at CityBuildingContests.net designed a number of contest maps. Of central importance in designing contest maps, and, in my opinion, good maps in general, is the creation of a challenge. I find there is nothing more satisfying than solving a difficult puzzle set by another map designer. The Caesar 3 map editor is quite a simple tool, but it does offer a large number of ways of creating challenges. I shall primarily discuss the methods I have used myself, since I am more familiar with them, but there will doubtless be others that I fail to mention here.

By way of a second disclaimer, you should always bear in mind what your target audience is. While I try to make my scenarios suitable for all players, they tend to be suited to the more advanced players. The greater the ability of the target audience, the more challenges you need, and the more difficult those challenges need to be.

## Setting High Goals

One of the simplest ways to create a challenge is to set goals that are near the limit of what is possible on the map. However, to do this, it is important that you can recognise what the limits imposed by your map are. For example, it is unreasonable to expect someone to achieve a population of 25000 on a tiny map. There simply isn't room for all the necessary houses, much less the associated support buildings. Furthermore, the goals that are achievable will to some extent depend on the rest of the scenario. In a map where there is no source of furniture, for example, the Prosperity Rating cannot exceed fifty. You must therefore take great care to ensure that the goals you set are actually possible: no-one will thank you for creating an impossible map. Quite often it is simply a matter of testing the map; if you cannot achieve the goals you have set, then you can hardly expect anyone else to. Of course, it is entirely possible that another player will come up with a method you had entirely neglected, but generally you should be able to complete your own designs.

## Resource Restriction

Restricting the resources available to a player can have several effects on their city: the amount of potential trade income can be reduced; higher housing levels can be blocked, or at least restricted in number; and the quality of the army can be similarly restricted. All of these create challenges for the player, for which a solution must be developed.

Of course, restricting resources affects the goals you can set: on a map without wine a Prosperity rating of 80 is a significant challenge, while a Prosperity rating of 81 on the same map is impossible.

There are three main ways to restrict the resources to which the player has access:

1. Choose the Empire State so key raw materials are not available.
2. Limit the number of raw material sites (rocks, trees, farmland, or, more subtly, water).
3. Disable key resource buildings like raw materials, workshops, or farms.

## Service Restriction

That last point brings me rather neatly to the third way of introducing a challenge: disabling critical buildings. By denying the player access to certain service buildings, you limit the levels of housing that are available. Similarly, denying some military structures means that any military action in the scenario takes on an increased difficulty.

A subtle variation on this theme is to pre-place certain key buildings and then disable them using Dragon2's saved game editor (available from the C3 downloads section of this site). To achieve this, first create your scenario, enabling the building in question. Start C3, load your new scenario, place the required buildings, and save. Fire up the saved game editor, load your newly-created saved game, and disable the relevant building. You can now distribute your scenario as a saved game. One word of warning: saved games created on a PC are not compatible with the Mac version of C3, nor are Mac saves PC compatible. However, a utility is available to convert between the two formats (visit Caesar Jan's Palace for more details).

Finally, I would advise designers who intend to disable critical buildings in a scenario to include some sort of mission briefing with their scenario (plain text is usually good for this), and to clearly indicate the restrictions in the briefing.
