# About the Author

- Name: Mark Snow
- Rank: Doctor (of Chemistry)
- Number: 27

Now I've got the basics out of the way... a few more details wouldn't go amiss. I was born, brought up, and still live, in England. Home is the sunny (well, on occasion) South coast of Hampshire, on the edge of the New Forest. The nearest significant town is Bournemouth. I studied at Merton College, Oxford, obtaining both and MChem (1st Class) and a DPhil. Whilst there, I represented the University at Korfball and Croquet, and the College at such diverse activities as Pool, Bridge, and Quizzing.

In addition to this lot, I am also an avid player of C3, Pharaoh, Zeus, Poseidon, Emperor, Children of the Nile, and C4. I still haven't played Cleopatra, although the CD has been gathering dust on my shelf for several years. Those of you who frequent the Heavengames or Tilted Mill Forums may know me by my alter egos of Caesar Alan.

It all started back in the summer of 1999, when I acquired a second-hand copy of C3, having played the Demo to death. When I ran into trouble, I discovered the wonders of C3 fansites, particularly the Forums. Since then I haven't looked back, and I eventually decided to share some of my experience with the world here. Several years of neglect have now passed, but I hope to have time to add more content again soon.

Familywise, I have just the one sibling, who is now happily married and living just down the road from home. Scary stuff. Just as well I have two very supportive parents...

If you have any comments about my site, I would be more than happy to hear them. Just drop me a line.
